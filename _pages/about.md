Hello My Name is Matthew McQuaigue and I am a PhD Student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. My focus area of research is: computer graphics, AR/VR rendering perception and interactive learning technologies. Recent work is on the subject of depth perception in virtual enviornments focused on the issues and solutions to this important topic.
In my free time I like to go to the gym and play video games.
