Matthew McQuaigue is a PhD candidate with a focus on computer graphics, interactive learning technologies, and AR/VR depth perception/rendering. His research centers on the perception of depth in virtual and augmented environments, exploring how different rendering methods affect accuracy. McQuaigue is also part of a team developing the BRIDGES and CS-Materials interactive learning technologies (https://cs-materials.herokuapp.com/) (https://bridgesuncc.github.io/). He has extensive experience working with various programming languages, including Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript, as well as WebGL, OpenGL, GLSL, D3, and Unity for rendering and visualization.

McQuaigue has held a variety of appointments, including working as a Developer and Research Assistant for BRIDGES/CS-Materials in Charlotte, NC, and as a Lecturer at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, for Data Structures and Algorithms and also served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Computer Graphics.

McQuaigue is earning his PhD in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where he is conducting research on egocentric depth perception in VR/AR. He is currently developing several notable projects, such as the Egocentric AR/VR Perceptual Matching and Depth Cue/Rendering Manipulated Framework, Real-time HoloLens Light Position Aquisition and IBL for testing Depth Perception Performance, and BRIDGES 3D rendering engine for cs1/cs2 student learning. He also holds a Master's Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Visualization and Computer Graphics, as well as a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. He has received several honors and awards, including the GSSF Funding, Atkins Undergraduate Research Award, CCI High Achiving Award, and Being a CCI Research Scholar. McQuaigue has published several peer-reviewed papers on computer science education and technology.
