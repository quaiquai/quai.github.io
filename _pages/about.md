Hello, I am a PhD candidate with a focus on computer graphics, interactive learning technologies, and AR/VR depth perception/rendering. My research centers on the perception of depth in virtual and augmented environments, exploring how different rendering methods affect accuracy. I am also part of a team developing the BRIDGES and CS-Materials interactive learning technologies (https://cs-materials.herokuapp.com/) (https://bridgesuncc.github.io/).

I have held a variety of appointments, including working as a Developer and Research Assistant for BRIDGES/CS-Materials in Charlotte, NC, and as a Lecturer at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, for Data Structures and Algorithms and also serving as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Computer Graphics.

I am earning my PhD in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where I am conducting research on egocentric depth perception in VR/AR. I am currently developing several notable projects, such as the Egocentric AR/VR Perceptual Matching and Depth Cue/Rendering Manipulated Framework, Real-time HoloLens Light Position Aquisition and IBL for testing Depth Perception Performance, and BRIDGES 3D rendering engine for cs1/cs2 student learning. 

I have received several honors and awards, including the GSSF Funding, Atkins Undergraduate Research Award, CCI High Achiving Award, and Being a CCI Research Scholar. I have published several peer-reviewed papers on computer science education and technology.
I also hold a Master's Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Visualization and Computer Graphics, as well as a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
