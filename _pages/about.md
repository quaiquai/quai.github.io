Hello My Name is Matthew McQuaigue and I am a PhD Student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. My focus area of research is: computer graphics, AR/VR rendering perception and interactive learning technologies. My current work is in investigating depth perception in virtual and augmented environments and how the combination of depth cues and graphical fidelity/information affect accuracy.
