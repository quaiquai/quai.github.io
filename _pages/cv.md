# **Matthew** **McQuaigue**

PhD CANDIDATE · COMPUTER GRAPHICS · AR/VR · INTERACTIVE LEARNING TECH · VISUALIZATION
 mmcquaig@uncc.edu | [http://quaiquai.github.io] |

_ **My research focuses on egocentric depth perception in virtual and augmented environments.** _ _Specifically, I study how different rendering methods (shading, PBR, lighting, texturing) affect an observer's performance to perceive depth in VR/AR accurately. I am also a part of a research team creating interactive learning technologies called BRIDGES and CS-Materials._

_I have worked extensively in rendering and visualization using_ _ **WebGL, OpenGL, D3, and Unity** __. I have experience using_ _ **Java, C++, Python, and Javascript** _ _for my languages_

# Projects

1. **Real-time HoloLens Light Position Aquisition and IBL (PhD Work Under Development)**
2. **Egocentric AR/VR Perceptual Matching and Depth Cue/Rendering Manipulated Framework (PhD Work Under Development)**
3. **BRIDGES 3D ||** A 3D rendering engine designed for entry-level undergraduate students to learn computer science concepts through the creation and manipulation of games and graphics projects. This works within the BRIDGES API toolkit, providing users high-level function calls and objects to create 3D scenes using Java, C++, and Python.
  - Fully designed intuitive API that abstracts away the complexities of low-level graphics programming, allowing students to focus on high-level concepts such as scene management and object placement.
  - Facilitated smooth integration into the BRIDGES toolkit by constructing scene format for serialization and communication with the server for rendering.
  - Developed a flexible and extensible architecture that allows for easy integration of new features and modules, such as physics simulation, particle systems, and scripting languages.
  - Worked closely with instructors and curriculum developers to ensure that the engine aligns with learning objectives

1. **BRIDGES**** ||** Software infrastructure designed to enable the creation of data structures by providing students with a simplified API that allows parsing interesting data sets, such as those from popular social networks (e.g., Twitter, Facebook), and also creates visualizations of data structures.
  - Maintained C++, Java, and Python toolkit API development
  - Performed backend maintenance for new visualization renderings and package upgrades
  - Developed DS visualizations using D3 and 3D engine development using WebGL
  - Insured quality code review and task delegation to other developers

1. **CS-Materials ||** Webtool for creating, analyzing and searching for computer science materials that are classified against the ACM and PDC guidelines. Providing a visualization engine for aligning and audit of instructor courses and learning material.
  - Fully developed front-end architecture and data pipeline for complex visualizations using REACT
  - Designed scientific visualizations using D3 with customized radial tree layouts and binary matrix clustering
  - Populated site with data from the backend using RESTful API
  - Helped conduct workshops and guest talks

1. **GLSL Compute Path Tracer ||** A simple path tracing algorithm implementation using only OpenGL GLSL compute shaders for real-time rendering.
  - Implemented unidirectional path tracing algorithm in GLSL shaders.
  - Created support for diffuse, specular, emissive materials, and IBL allowing for realistic shading of 3D objects.
  - Implemented anti-aliasing techniques to reduce jagged edges and smooth out rendered images.
  - Optimized the rendering pipeline using importance sampling and BVH to achieve real-time performance.
